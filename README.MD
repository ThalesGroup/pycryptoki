## Pycryptoki
[![Doc Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pycryptoki/badge/?version=latest)](http://pycryptoki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/6236/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/6236)

Pycryptoki is a python wrapper around the PKCS11 library.

## Documentation

Latest API documentation can be found on [readthedocs](http://pycryptoki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


## Installation

pip install git+https://github.com/ThalesGroup/pycryptoki

## Key Generation Example

```py
from pycryptoki.default_templates import *
from pycryptoki.defines import *
from pycryptoki.key_generator import *
from pycryptoki.session_management import *
from pycryptoki.encryption import *


c_initialize_ex()
auth_session = c_open_session_ex(0)   # HSM slot # in this example is 0
login_ex(auth_session, 0, 'userpin')  # 0 is still the slot number, ‘userpin’ should be replaced by your password (None if PED or no challenge)

# Get some default templates
# They are simple python dictionaries, and can be modified to suit needs.
pub_template, priv_template = get_default_key_pair_template(CKM_RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN)

# Modifying template would look like:
pub_template[CKA_LABEL] = "RSA PKCS Pub Key"
pub_template[CKA_MODULUS_BITS] = 2048   # 2048 key size

pubkey, privkey = c_generate_key_pair_ex(auth_session, CKM_RSA_PKCS_KEY_PAIR_GEN, pub_template, priv_template)
print("Generated Private key at %s and Public key at %s" % (privkey, pubkey))

c_logout_ex(auth_session)
c_close_session_ex(auth_session)
c_finalize_ex()
```
## Verbose logging

If you want to see what calls to the C library are being performed, set pycryptoki logging to `DEBUG`:

```py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Tests

Test requirements can be installed via `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`.

Unittests can be run on any environment via:
```
py.test tests/unittests
```

Functional tests require an HSM to test against, and will actively test the integration
 with the libCryptoki library. This *will* create and destroy objects on the HSM, so don't run
  on a production HSM!

```
py.test tests/functional --slot=<slot_num> [--reset] [--password=<pwd>] [--copassword=<pwd>] [--user=<user>] [--loglevel=<level>]
```

### Adding new tests

Tests for new functionality should be added as the new commands are added. Ideally functional
tests for things that hit an HSM, and unittests for more complicated pure-python handling.
